## 👋 I’m **passionate about design and development**

As a Creative Technologist, I specialize in designing and developing both the front-end and back-end of digital products. My role bridges creativity and technology, allowing me to craft user-centric interfaces while ensuring seamless functionality and performance behind the scenes. I blend UI/UX design with coding expertise to create innovative, visually engaging, and technically robust solutions.
