## 👋 I’m **Anti Software Engineer**

I defy conventional development by crafting bold, unconventional digital experiences. My approach fuses dynamic UI/UX design with the power of front-end technologies like Vue.js and React, while my back-end expertise in Python ensures functionality that disrupts the norm. I don’t just build software; I challenge the standard ways it’s created, delivering interfaces and systems that are as striking as they are effective.
